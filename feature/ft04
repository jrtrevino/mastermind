Tests Mastermind's handling of invalid seed values - specifically non-numeric
values. The reference solution expects int values for the seed and you will
not be tested with values outside the range of an int.

Note:

   1) Even though srand's argument is unsigned C allows you to pass negative
      values - they are simply interpreted as large unsigned values. So, don't
      over-think this one - simply attempt to read the seed using the %d flag
      and assume it does not exceed the range of an int.
