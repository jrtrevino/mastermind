Tests Mastermind's handling of "extra" input entered after each good input for
seed, maximum letter, number of positions, number of guesses, and the guesses
themselves to verify that any extra stuff entered by the user is being skipped
over. Suggestions for how to do this are found in the assignment.

For example:
   
   Enter the seed for random number generation: 2 extra stuff
   Enter the maximum letter for the game (A-Z): W123456...whatever!
   Enter the number of positions for the game (1-8): 6 abc 123
   Enter the number of guesses allowed for the game: 10XYZ 7.8 hmmmmm

   Enter guess 1: AMBAAAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 123
   Nope, 0 exact guesses and 1 inexact guesses

   Enter guess 2: TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
   Nope, 1 exact guesses and 0 inexact guesses

   Enter guess 3: KAVTPO987654321 extra stuff!

   Wow, you won in 3 guesses - well done!
